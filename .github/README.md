# Dotfiles
My configs, scripts, and functions. Commonly known as dotfiles!

## I use:
[ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) to manage my zsh config. 
[yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) to manage my dotfiles. 

To install, run
```shell
brew install yadm
yadm clone https://github.com/jlehrer1/dotfiles
yadm bootstrap
```
