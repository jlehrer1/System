A visual inventory management system:
	- Drag and release to create palettes, shelves, etc
	- Label the items on the shelves
	- All items are indexed with amounts, reorganization ideas, etc
	- Good for small businesses with in home warehouses. They don't need a full
		corporate suite of software, but also would like to stay relatively organized.
